# Hello World!

## What is Soft2D-Unity?

Soft2D is a 2D real-time multi-material physics engine powered by the Taichi-AOT feature. By Taichi, Soft2D could accelerate the simulation on GPU, and can run on different devices and platforms:

- [x] Linux
- [x] Windows
- [x] Android
- [x] macOS
- [x] iOS

And Soft2D-Unity plugin further encapsulates the Soft2D functions and provides API interfaces, allowing users to freely configure the physical environment, add simulated objects, and set their properties. Since the simulation process is automatically performed within Soft2D, users do not need to master the relevant knowledge of physical simulation to use the Soft2D-Unity plugin effectively.

## Features

- Support running on **five major platforms**

- Support physics simulation of multiple materials and shapes

- [x] Fluid

- [x] Sand

- [x] Snow

- [x] Elastic

- **Real** physics simulation based on Taichi language

- Suitable for **3D** scenes, includes materials specifically designed for 3D scenes

- Contains **many prototypes** for users to understand the functionality of the plugin

- Deeply integrated with Unity, allowing particles to interact with Unity's colliders and triggers

- No need for Unity Pro

- Completely **free**!
