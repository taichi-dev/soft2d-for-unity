# Kinematics

Kinematics is a structure specifying the initial motion state of a Soft2D object.

## Attributes

- Center
  - The coordinates of the center of the object.
- Rotation
  - The rotation angle of the object, which is measured in degrees.
- Linear Velocity
  - The linear velocity of the object, which is measured in m/s.
- Angular Velocity
  - The angular velocity of the object, which is measured in s^-1.
- Motion State
  - The motion state of the object (dynamic or static).
